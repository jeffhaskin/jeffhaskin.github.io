This repository is maintained primarily by AI agents. Feel free to modify and extend it when implementing new features.

Policy:
- On each tools category page (e.g., development-tools.html, image-tools.html), links to individual tool pages must be presented as cards. Use a container with the `gallery` class and wrap each link in a `div` with the `card` class, matching the styling on tools.html.
- HTML pages go in the `/templates` folder.
- CSS and Javascript files go in the `/static` folder.
- Tool pages go in the `/tools/tool_pages` folder.
